# Hey! Hola!

My name is Julieta, I am from Argentina.

I am a [zoologist](https://www.fcnym.unlp.edu.ar/grado/carreras/licenciatura-en-biologia-orientacion-zoologia/){:target="_blank"} from the [Universidad Nacional de La Plata](https://unlp.edu.ar/){:target="_blank"}.

For the last few years I have been working as a data scientist, both in research and private companies.

## Some stuff that I love
   - **Learning new things and implementing them!** - The more practical the better. I love to play around with new topics (like practicing how to make a *github page*, implementing model tracking with *Mlflow* or learning *AWS Cloud architecture*).
   - **Nature tech** - Using technology to solve real and urgent problems, like climate change and biodiversity loss.
   - **Open science** - I am very concerned about the current state of the academic system and how knowledge is being built, and I think we need to make a deep shift to make it work. I believe open knowledge is the way to do this. Even though I know the steps and details to get there are not clear, I want to work towards building a better system where science is really a way to create knowledge for ***all*** of us.


## Some stuff that I'm proud of
 - **Being part of the [csv,conf](https://csvconf.com/){:target="_blank"} organization** - Since 2022 I've been a part of the organising team and I've helped with v7, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and v8, in Puebla, MÃ©xico. It's hard work but sooo worth it.
 - **Being the [Open Knowledge Network](https://okfn.org/en/network/){:target="_blank"} Latin American Hub Coordinator** - Recently I started a new temporal role as [Regional Coordinator for the Latinamerican Hub](https://blog.okfn.org/2024/04/24/open-knowledge-network-introducing-the-regional-hubs-prototype-programme/){:target="_blank"} of the OKFN as a part of a prototype project that tries to decentralize the community and make sure each region can focus on the issues they're facing and speaking their own language.
 - **Leading a team during the 2023 UN Datathon** - We worked ina very fun project called "Monitoring Land Use in Biodiversity Hotspots Affected by Forest Loss". You can find part of the work [here](https://github.com/JuliMillan/UN-Datathon-2023){:target="_blank"}.
